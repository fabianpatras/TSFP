# Type System and Functional Programming

Hello, this is a repository containing **my** solved lab materials for Type System and Functional Programming course from Automatic Control and Computer Science, UPB.

Teacher: Mihnea Costin MURARU

Even if they are written by me does not mean that all the solves are original :P. I am learning.

## Resoureces

- [Learn you a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)
- [TSFP Labs](http://elf.cs.pub.ro/tsfp/labs/haskell-types)

  - Link: http://elf.cs.pub.ro/tsfp/labs/haskell-intro
  - Path: `IntroSkel/`
  - It is supposed to be a "quick" recap of Haskell language features / functional programming concepts in general.
  - Chapters 1-6, optionally 7 from [`Learn you a haskell`](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) are recommended for this
