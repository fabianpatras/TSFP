# Type System and Functional Programming

Hello, this is a repository containing **my** solved lab materials for Type System and Functional Programming course from Automatic Control and Computer Science, UPB.

Teacher: Mihnea Costin MURARU

Even if they are written by me does not mean that all the solves are original :P. I am learning.
